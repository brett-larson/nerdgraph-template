Initial Query to delete one account
{
  actor {
    account(id: 6317713) {
      id
      name
      isCanceled
    }
  }
}

Results when account is active:

{
  "data": {
    "accountManagementCancelAccount": {
      "id": 6317713,
      "isCanceled": true,
      "name": "Playground"
    }
  }
}

Results when the account is already canceled:

{
  "data": {
    "accountManagementCancelAccount": {
      "id": 6317713,
      "isCanceled": true,
      "name": "Playground"
    }
  }
}

No difference if the account is active vs. canceled when canceling account.

The cancellation takes maybe 5 seconds to complete. User access is removed
and API keys are deleted.
